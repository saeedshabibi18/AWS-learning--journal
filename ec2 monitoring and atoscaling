# EC2 CPU Monitoring & Auto Scaling (Free Tier Safe)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to monitor EC2 CPU utilization using CloudWatch and design Auto Scaling logic based on CPU usage, while keeping everything within AWS Free Tier limits.

## Objective
- Monitor EC2 CPU utilization
- Detect high CPU automatically
- Evaluate Auto Scaling decisions
- Avoid unnecessary AWS costs

## AWS Services Used
- EC2
- CloudWatch
- SNS
- EC2 Auto Scalin

## Why This Project Matters
- Reflects real industry monitoring practices
- Shows understanding of CPU vs storage decisions
- Demonstrates cost-aware cloud design

STEPS
# Step-by-Step Implementation

## Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance
- Instance type: t2.micro (Free Tier)
- OS: Amazon Linux
- Purpose: Host workload and generate CPU metrics

---

## Step 2: Create SNS Topic
- Created an SNS topic for email alerts
- Subscribed email and confirmed subscription
- Purpose: Notify when CPU crosses threshold

---

## Step 3: Create CloudWatch Alarm
- Metric: EC2 CPUUtilization
- Threshold: CPU > 40%
- Action: Send notification to SNS
- Purpose: Convert CPU data into alerts

---

## Step 4: Create Launch Template
- Defined AMI, instance type, and security group
- Purpose: Blueprint for Auto Scaling instances

Why needed:
- Auto Scaling requires a standard configuration
- Ensures consistency during scaling

---

## Step 5: Create Auto Scaling Group (Free Tier Safe)
- Min capacity: 1
- Desired capacity: 1
- Max capacity: 1
- No Load Balancer attached

Why needed:
- Manages EC2 instance count
- Evaluates scaling decisions automatically
- Capacity limits prevent extra cost

---

## Step 6: Attach CPU-Based Scaling Policy
- Policy type: Target Tracking
- Metric: Average CPU Utilization
- Target value: 40%

Why needed:
- Defines WHEN Auto Scaling should react
- Separates monitoring from decision logic

---

## Step 7: Test CPU Increase
